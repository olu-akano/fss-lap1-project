# Journ-It

Journ-It is our LAP-1 Group project for the full stack squad. This is a community journaling website for anonymous users. It also has the following functionality for users:

•	Users are able to visit the website and anonymously post journal entries.

•	Users are able to add gifs from giphy in an entry using the giphy API.

•	Users are able to view other peoples' entries.

•	Users are able to be able to react to other peoples’ entries with an emoji.

•	Users are able to have three emojis to choose from.

•	Users are able to be able to comment on other people’s entries.

The website was deployed using Netlify for client and Heroku for the server (the website is deployed [here](https://journ-it.netlify.app/)). Please note that all the data sent from the client side is stored in a json file in the backend.

# Wins
The team really had an excellent workflow, every member took responsibility from the start.
# Challenges
One of our biggest challenges was debugging the emoji features to stop the reaction count from restarting after refreshing. This was left as a future feature.
